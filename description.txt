Hey PipeKit Team!

1. In routes.js, I used the normalizeHtml function from the jsdom package.
2. In React, redux applications prefer to use normalized data structures
for displaying tree view elements.
3. The following DOM structure was created using normalizeHtml:

const nodes = {
    1: {
       nodeName: 'body',
       children: [2, 3]
    },
    2: {
        nodeName: 'div',
        children: []
    },
    3: {
        nodeName: 'div',
        children: []
    },
    ...
};

4. I created TreeItem component to render this structure on the client side
5. TreeItem is using Node, Icon, Indent - components
6. I did not use CSS because there was an issue importing it in react components,
   It seems some package is missing, so I didn't waste time on that, just used inline styles instead

Looking forward to hearing feedback from you.
